# GPT-2 Text Generation Model
This repository contains a project built using the pre-trained GPT-2 language model from Hugging Face's transformers library. The model is designed for generating coherent and contextually relevant text based on input prompts.

## Features:
- Pre-trained GPT-2 Model: Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-2 model, which is capable of generating high-quality text.
- Interactive Text Generation: Given an input prompt, the model can generate responses that follow a logical sequence, making it ideal for tasks such as text completion, story generation, and more.
- Customizable Parameters: Users can easily adjust parameters like temperature, top_k, and top_p to control the randomness, creativity, and length of the generated text.
- Easy Integration: The project can be extended or integrated into other applications, including content generation systems, chatbots, or creative writing tools.

## How It Works:

The GPT-2 model is loaded using Hugging Face's transformers library.
Users can input any text prompt, and the model will generate a continuation of the input text.
The model can handle various text lengths, generating a controlled number of tokens for each response.

## Customization:
- Temperature: Adjusts the creativity of the model's outputs.
- Top-k Sampling: Limits the sampling pool to the top K probable next tokens.
- Top-p Sampling: Uses nucleus sampling to generate more diverse and realistic text.
- 
## Applications:
- Story generation: Generate creative content or continue existing stories.
- Text completion: Use the model to complete sentences, paragraphs, or documents.
- Chatbots: Extend the model to serve as the core of a conversational AI system.
- Creative writing assistance: Use the model to assist in generating new ideas for writing projects.
